# 🌌 Nebula Notebook: A Multi-Modal Data Visualization Playground

> *“Where computation meets chaos, and patterns emerge in living color.”*

Nebula Notebook is an **interactive playground of data visualization experiments** written in JavaScript (React, D3, Three.js, Recharts, and p5.js).  
It combines **academic rigor** (statistical models, clustering, regression, correlations) with **generative artistry** (3D spiral clouds, flow fields, noise-based heatmaps) to create a hybrid environment of *analysis, simulation, and aesthetic discovery*.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📈 **Statistical Simulations**
  - Time-series arcade with sine, cosine, and chaotic oscillations.
  - Correlation lab with live Pearson’s *r* and regression line fitting.

* 🔬 **Machine Learning Visuals**
  - K-Means clustering on two-moon datasets with adjustable noise.
  - Interactive cluster centers and decision boundaries.

* 🌐 **Network Physics**
  - Force-directed graph playground using D3 force simulation.

* 🌌 **Generative Art & Chaos**
  - 3D spiral point-cloud nebula (Three.js).
  - Flow-field ribbons (p5.js).
  - Procedural noise-based heatmap textures.

* 🎨 **Playful Dashboards**
  - Radar charts of “skills” (Math, JS, Three.js, etc.).
  - Editable donut chart for data-science time allocation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nebula-notebook.git
cd nebula-notebook
npm install
npm run dev
````

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 📓 Running in Google Colab

Nebula Notebook is built in JavaScript, but you can explore it in **Google Colab** via two approaches:

1. **Embed HTML/JS** directly inside Colab with `IPython.display.HTML`.
2. **Run a React app in Colab** with a local server + ngrok for public access.

See [Colab Integration Guide](./docs/colab.md) for step-by-step setup.

## 🎓 Academic Rationale

Nebula Notebook isn’t just a toy—it’s a **pedagogical artifact**.
It’s designed to:

1. **Demystify data science** by letting users *see* regression, clustering, and correlation in real time.
2. **Bridge disciplines** by merging computational statistics with generative art.
3. **Encourage exploration** of unexpected behaviors emerging from simple rules.
4. **Serve as a sandbox** for teaching, experimenting, or just enjoying the aesthetics of math.

---

## 🌍 Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from:

* **Mathematical notebooks** (*Gauss → Jupyter → Observable*).
* **Generative art pioneers** (Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman).
* **Data-science education** and the belief that visualization is the fastest way to intuition.
